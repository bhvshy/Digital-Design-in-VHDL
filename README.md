# Digital Circuit Designs using VHDL

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of digital circuit designs implemented in **VHDL** as part of laboratory experiments for a **Digital Circuits Lab**. These experiments were conducted to understand and implement various combinational and sequential circuits using **Intel Quartus Prime** and tested on the **Intel Xen-10 board** developed at IIT Bombay. The repository showcases different modeling styles in VHDL, including **structural, behavioral, and dataflow modeling**.

## Circuits Included
This repository features a variety of digital designs, including:

- **Combinational Circuits**:
  - Multiplexers (2x1, 4x1, 4-bit 4x1 MUX)
  - Encoders (4-to-2, 8-to-3, Priority Encoder)
  - Comparators (4-bit Comparator)
  - Logic Gates (AND, OR, XOR using NAND)
  - Majority Circuit

- **Arithmetic Circuits**:
  - 4-bit Adder-Subtractor
  - BCD Adder-Subtractor
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
  - Shift-Subtract Divider

- **Sequential Circuits**:
  - Finite State Machine (FSM)
  - Sequence Generator
  - String Detector

- **SPI Communication**:
  - SPI Master Modules (ADC, DAC, Combination of ADC and DAC)
  - Clock Divider
  - 
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document the experiments conducted in the **Digital Circuits Lab** and provide a structured collection of VHDL implementations. These designs serve students and professionals interested in hardware description languages, FPGA design, and digital logic design. By organizing these circuits into a single repository, the goal is to make it easier for others to study, modify, and expand upon the provided implementations.

## Development Tools
- **Intel Quartus Prime** for synthesis and simulation
- **UrJTAG** with **ScanChain** for circuit testing
- **Intel Xen-10 board** for hardware validation
